# Adaptation of data domains in federated learning in the problem of breast mammography image classification

## Project goal
The aim of the project is a comparative analysis of the impact of various methods of adapting the fields of data generation (the impact of the diversity of devices, image formats, etc.) on the effects of classification of mammographic images using federated learning and the adaptation of the best method in the form of a demonstrator.


## Project to do list
- [x] add form for client
- [x] add table with all clients
- [x] add form for server
- [x] change way of post data from server's form
- [x] secure the forms
- [x] write method for Client Class for all learing process
- [ ] write a system to manage training loop (how many epochs, count epochs, update clients to train, the training need to be min 2 clients)
- [ ] write federated network
- [ ] write learing process
- [ ] write a sql function to apply FedAvg strategy
- [ ] add table with server results
- [ ] add table with clients results
